In  the first Page, I made the Navbar using the Grid box bu dividing the grid into 10 parts and the last three parts are given to the buttons like Home, Grid and last is My linkedlin Id.\
then, In the main Page, I have used Grid box to seperate all into three sections. then, in the last Grid, I again made a 3*3 grid with Blue color and By, hovering it, it changes its color to Red.
In the second Page, web project inspired by the popular Netflix series "Squid Game." The design features a dark and mysterious theme with glowing red background lights. I also add The Squid Game based font and My Photo. I have also added My Linkedin id, Insta Id and My GithubId.
